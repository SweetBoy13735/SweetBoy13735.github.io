As it says on the tin, this project is holding all of the source code for my portfolio website, which can be viewed [here](https://Sweetboy13735.github.io).

## Support
If you encounter any issues on the website, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/Sweetboy13735.github.io/issues) (Provided it hasn't been logged already) or [E-mail me](mailto:ramonegraham@gmail.com), describing fully what the problem is.

## Roadmap
Throughout this project's development, I'll be using the [Git Flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A57dbxFl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pyeszwkiezdk5owzq2tq.png) branching method to keep track of all changes.

I do have a few plans on what the website shall look like, but since I'm currently taking a course on Web Development, getting the first few pages up will take a while.

## [Contributing](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/Sweetboy13735.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
As this is my own portfolio page, I'm looking to do more of the heavy-lifting myself, but I am open to small contributions. Please check out the link above for more info.
