# Contributing to SweetBoy's Portfolio
First of all, thanks for having an interest in contributing! üòÅ

Since it's my portfolio, I'll be doing the heavy-lifting myself. However, I'm open to small contributions. These are:
- Issue submissions (Bug reports, potential feature requests, etc...)
- Hotfixes

## Issue submissions
If you encounter any problems or you have an idea for a potential feature, the best way you can highlight it is to [create an issue](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/SweetBoy13735.github.io/issues) or [E-Mail me](mailto:ramonegraham@gmail.com) (Provided it hasn't been logged already).

If you've spotted a bug:
1. Please prefix your title with "**BUG REPORT:** ", leading on with the bug at hand.
2. Dive into further detail of what happened in the description. If possible, please include console outputs and/or steps to reproduce the bug.

If you want to request a feature:
1. Please prefix your title with "**FEATURE REQUEST:** ", leading on with the feature you'd like.
2. Dive into further detail of what you'd like in the description. Please include any images or diagrams that help illustrate your points.
- **PLEASE NOTE:** Your feature may be rejected if I think it doesn't fit for my portfolio. Any features that fall into this group will be commented on, explaining why.

## Hotfixes
If you'd like to take on a bug that's unassigned, here's what you'll need to do:
1. Fork the repository and commit your fixes to a separate branch off **master**.
2. Once your changes have been made, create a pull request into the origin's master branch and title your request as "**HOTFIX:** ", leading on with the bug you're tackling. Add me (SweetBoy13735) as a reviewer of the changes.
3. I'll review the changes. If approved, I'll merge the changes into master. Otherwise, please amend them as requested and re-request the review again, looping this step.
